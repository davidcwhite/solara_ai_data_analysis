# Solara AI Data Analysis - Technical Documentation

## Overview

This document provides technical details about the current implementation of the Solara AI Data Analysis application. It serves as a reference for developers working on the project.

## Project Structure

The application is built with Solara and integrates OpenAI's GPT models for AI chat capabilities. The main application code is in `app.py` at the root of the project.

## Components

### Main Application

The main application is structured as a Solara application with the following key components:

- **Page Layout**: The application uses a responsive layout with a main content area and a slide-out chat panel.
- **Data Grid**: Implemented using `ipyaggrid` to display interactive data tables.
- **Chat Panel**: A slide-out panel for AI chat interactions.

### Data Grid Implementation

The data grid is implemented using `ipyaggrid`, which provides powerful data grid capabilities:

```python
@solara.component
def DataGrid():
    """Data grid component using ipyaggrid."""
    # Configure the grid options
    grid_options = {
        'columnDefs': [
            {'headerName': 'Order ID', 'field': 'Order ID', 'filter': True, 'sortable': True},
            # Additional column definitions...
        ],
        'defaultColDef': {
            'flex': 1,
            'minWidth': 100,
            'filter': True,
            'sortable': True,
            'resizable': True,
        },
        'enableRangeSelection': True,
        'animateRows': True,
        'pagination': True,
        'paginationPageSize': 10,
    }
    
    # Convert DataFrame to dictionary for the grid
    data = sales_data.to_dict('records')
    
    # Create a container for the grid
    with solara.Column(style={"height": "500px", "width": "100%"}):
        # Create the grid
        grid = Grid(
            grid_data=data,
            grid_options=grid_options,
            theme="ag-theme-balham",
            columns_fit="auto",
            index=False,
            height=500  # Integer value as required by ipyaggrid
        )
        solara.display(grid)
```

### AI Chat Implementation

The AI chat functionality uses OpenAI's API to provide intelligent responses to user queries:

```python
@solara.component
def ChatPanel():
    """Chat panel component for AI interaction."""
    # Implementation details...
```

## Dependencies

The application relies on the following key dependencies:

- **Solara**: For building the reactive web application
- **OpenAI**: For AI chat capabilities
- **ipyaggrid**: For interactive data grids
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations

## Environment Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration, which should be stored in a `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Known Issues and Limitations

- The ipyaggrid integration may show console errors but the functionality works correctly.
- The application is currently using sample data; integration with real data sources is planned for future releases.

## Future Technical Considerations

- Improve error handling for API calls
- Enhance the data grid with additional features
- Optimize performance for larger datasets
